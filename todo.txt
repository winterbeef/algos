You'll do fine. Focus on data structures. Using stacks, queues, linked lists

Find a couple questions from cracking the coding interview and work through them without looking at the answers

It's not about solving it as quickly as possible it's about your thought process so make sure to over communicate and def ask questions up front to make sure you understand it and to show them you aren't afraid to ask questions

Also helps to plan out what you'll do before you start writing out the code. Walk through the steps

They want to see what and how you're thinking about things so just talk it out as you go

Focus on Culture

levelling: @5 or 6 (interview performance + tony)
as senior, not nec, managment, but *lead*.
lead a *product*, not *team*
moving from product to product -- I track.
initial team @ bootcamp
(interest, impact and learning should drive team membership)
(infrastructure (lots of teams)) or (core)

BOOTCAMP (onboarding)
- exposure to teams, culture
- like a career fair
- 40-50 teams that have a need
- languages, goals
- I choose 3 teams -- ship and build a product
- 6-8 weeks
- not always in NYC
- 2 in menlo
- some in nyc
- some in menlo
